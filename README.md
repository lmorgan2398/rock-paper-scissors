# rock-paper-scissors
This project has been created to demonstrate my understanding 
of basic JavaScript. It will run a console-based game of Rock, 
Paper, Scissors against the computer. The winner will be declared 
after 5 rounds.

The second and current iteration of this project has is an updated 
version of Rock, Paper, Scissors themed around Minecraft called 'Rock, 
Paper, Shears.' The game now has a fully functional UI and is played 
until either the player or the computer reaches 5 won rounds, upon which 
a winner is declared. Functionality has been added to replay the game, as 
well.
